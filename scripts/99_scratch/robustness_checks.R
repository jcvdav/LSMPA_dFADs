# # Robustness checks:
# 
# - Repeat 03_dfad_gradient analysis with 0-100 and 100-200 NM
# - Repeat 03_dfad_gradient analysis with current buffers and absolute dFAD set numbers
# - Repeat 03_dfad_gradient at the grid-cell level
# - Normalize dFAD effort by area and repeat the above exercises, as relevant
